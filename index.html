                    One of my favourite places in Calgary is the Scottia Bank Saddledome, home of the Calgary Flames, Calgary Roughnecks and the Calgary Hitmen.  
                    The Saddledome has been around since 1983 and is a major landmark to Calgary and its smaller surrounding towns. 
                    The reason I like the Saddledome is because of the memories I have created there, watching many if not all of the Calgary Roughnecks games over the last 3 seasons with my friends and family. 
                    The Scottia Bank Saddledome along with the sports events, also hosts concerts and draws people from all over to come expirience an event within its walls.
