                    One of my favourite places in Calgary is the Scottia Bank Saddledome, home of the Calgary Flames, Calgary Roughnecks and the Calgary Hitmen.  
                    The Saddledome has been around since 1983 and is a major landmark to Calgary and its smaller surrounding towns.  
                    The Scottia Bank Saddledome along with the sports events, also hosts concerts and draws people from all over to come expirience an event in the Saddledome. 
                    The reason I like the Saddledome is because of the memories I have created there. I have watched the nearly all of the Calgary Roughnecks games over the last 4 seasons with my friends and family.

                    Another place I love to visit is Hawaii. I have been to Hawaii many times with my family and visited all of the islands.
                    During these travels, I have found that my favourite island to be Maui. 
                    While Waikiki and Honolulu are amazing places to vist with lots of beautiful beaches, and things to do the atmosphere of Maui suits my life style the best.
                    Maui I find is for a relaxed vacation, with an active nightlife and laid back day activities while, Waikiki is more energetic with much more commercialism.
                    Honolulu, on the other hand is a more day time acvitity focused island and better for those that want easy going nights and early mornings.

                    Grassi Lakes in Canmore Alberta is on of my favourite hikes to do in the summer.
                    I enjoy the hike due to several things, one being the views during on the way up and the beautiful lakes at the top.
                    Second being the difficulty of the hike itself along with the preperation needed to go and do the hike. the hike is relatively easy to do and can be done more or less on a whim due to being a 4km round trip.
                    The hike also was one of the first hikes that I had ever done with my family, and I rutinely go back every 1-2 years.
                    Grassi Lakes is also a great hike to do if you have a dog as it is a dog friendly trial.
                    I highly recommend this hike to anyone begining and not used to hiking or just looking to get outside for the better part of the day.
