                    One of my favourite places in Calgary is the Scottia Bank Saddledome, home of the Calgary Flames, Calgary Roughnecks and the Calgary Hitmen.  
                    The Saddledome has been around since 1983 and is a major landmark to Calgary and its smaller surrounding towns. 
                    The reason I like the Saddledome is because of the memories I have created there, watching many if not all of the Calgary Roughnecks games over the last 3 seasons with my friends and family. 
                    The Scottia Bank Saddledome along with the sports events, also hosts concerts and draws people from all over to come expirience an event within its walls.

                    Another place I love to visit is Hawaii. I have been to Hawaii many times with my family and visited all of the islands.
                    During these travels, I have found that my favourite island to be Maui. While Waikiki and Honolulu are amazing places to vist with lots of beautiful beaches, and things to do the atmosphere of Maui suits my life style the best.
                    Maui I find is for a relaxed vacation, with an active nightlife and laid back day activities while, Waikiki is more energetic with much more commercialism. Honolulu, on the other hand is a more day time acvitity focused island and better for those that want easy going nights and early mornings.
