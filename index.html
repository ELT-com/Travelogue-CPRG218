                    One of my favourite places in Calgary is the Scotiabank Saddledome, home of the Calgary Flames, Calgary Roughnecks, and the Calgary Hitmen.  
                    The Saddledome has been around since 1983 and is a major landmark in Calgary and its smaller surrounding towns.  
                    The Scotiabank Saddledome, along with the sports events, also hosts concerts and draws people from all over to experience an event in the Saddledome. 
                    The reason I like the Saddledome is because of the memories I have created there. I have watched nearly all of the Calgary Roughnecks games over the last 4 seasons with my friends and family.

                    During these travels, I have found that my favourite island is Maui. 
                    While Waikiki and Honolulu are amazing places to visit with lots of beautiful beaches and things to do, the atmosphere of Maui suits my lifestyle the best.
                    Maui, I find, is for a relaxed vacation, with an active nightlife and laid-back day activities, while Waikiki is more energetic with much more commercialism.
                    Honolulu, on the other hand, is a more daytime activity-focused island and better for those who want easy-going nights and early mornings.

                    Grassi Lakes in Canmore, Alberta, is one of my favourite hikes to do in the summer.
                    I enjoy the hike for several things, one being the views on the way up and the beautiful lakes at the top.
                    Second, the difficulty of the hike itself, along with the preparation needed to go and do the hike. The hike is relatively easy to do and can be done more or less on a whim due to being a 4km round trip.
                    The hike was also one of the first hikes that I had ever done with my family, and I routinely go back every 1-2 years.
                    Grassi Lakes is also a great hike to do if you have a dog, as it is a dog-friendly trail.
                    I highly recommend this hike to anyone who is beginning and not used to hiking, or just looking to get outside for the better part of the day.
